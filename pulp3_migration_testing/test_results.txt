Test that fully-utilizes the migration test setup script

NOTE: To make Docker syncing work properly I needed to patch in this PR: https://github.com/pulp/nectar/pull/66/files

MAIN TEST

Repos:
	51 BusyBox (Docker)
	51 Alpine (Docker)
	51 Bash (Docker)
	51 Large File (70000 synced units)
	5 File with 10 uploaded files each

Content views:
	1 Large View with 100 versions:
		90 versions with all Docker repos
		5 versions with all repos
		5 versions with only Large File
	100 Little Views with 1 version each:
		All Docker repos

Results 1:
	Pulp 3 migration time: real 196m53.940s (3 hours, 17 minutes)
	Pulp 3 re-migration time: real 140m52.834s (2 hours, 21 minutes)
	Pulp 3 content switchover time: real 185m46.343s (3 hours, 6 minutes)
	This is quite slow.  To investigate further, run each step of Katello::Pulp3::MigrationSwitchover.run individually

Results 2
	Pulp 3 migration time: real    202m33.476s (3 hours, 23 minutes)
	Pulp 3 re-migration time: real    144m13.380s (2 hours, 24 minutes)
	Pulp 3 content switchover time:
		check_already_migrated_content: < 1 minute
		cleanup_v1_docker_tags:  < 1 minute
		migrated_content_type_check: < 1 minute
		combine_duplicate_docker_tags: ~ 7 minutes
			Newer result with otherwise similar results: ~ 4 minutes
		migrate_pulp3_hrefs: < 1 minute
		
Results 3
	Largely the same except:
		cleanup_v1_docker_tags:  ~2 minutes
		combine_duplicate_docker_tags: ~3 minutes
		
Results 4
	Same test, except:
		Deleted alpine1, bash1, busybox1, large_file1 to make orphaned content
	Pulp 3 migration time: ~2 hours, 44 minutes
		~8898 seconds of time in "suspended state" included in this, not sure why
	(ran delete_orphaned_content)
	Pulp 3 content switchover time:
		ERROR: at least one katello_docker_tags record has migrated_pulp3_href NULL value
			Only Docker tags have nil migrated_pulp3_href

TIER 2 TEST

Repos:
	72 BusyBox (Docker)
	51 Alpine (Docker)
	51 Bash (Docker)
	72 Large File (70,000 synced units)
	1 Very Large File (150,000 synced units)
	5 File with 10 uploaded files each

Content views:
	1 Large View with 100 versions:
		90 versions with all Docker repos
		5 versions with all Docker repos plus Large File
		5 versions with only Large File
	Another view with 10 versions:
		All Busybox only	
	100 Little Views with 1 version each:
		All Docker repos
	
Results 1 (python3-pulpcore-3.0.1-2, python3-pulp-2to3-migration-0.1.0-0.1.rc1)
	Pulp 3 delete orphans time: about 15 hours (https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6581)
	Pulp 3 migration time: real    298m35.417s (4 hours and 59 minutes)
	Pulp 3 re-migration time: 3 hours 43 minutes 1 seconds
	Pulp 3 content switchover time:  ERROR (due to old migration plugin version)
	
Results 2 (python3-pulpcore-3.2.1-1, python3-pulp-2to3-migration-0.2.0-0.1.b1
	Pulp 3 migration time: real    275m32.512s (4 Hours, 35 Minutes)
	Pulp 3 re-migration time:
