Test that fully-utilizes the migration test setup script

NOTE: To make Docker syncing work properly I needed to patch in this PR: https://github.com/pulp/nectar/pull/66/files

Repos:
	51 BusyBox (Docker)
	51 Alpine (Docker)
	51 Bash (Docker)
	51 Large File (70000 synced units)
	5 File with 10 uploaded files each

Content views:
	1 Large View with 100 versions:
		90 versions with all Docker repos
		5 versions with all repos
		5 versions with only Large File
	100 Little Views with 1 version each:
		All Docker repos

Results 1:
	Pulp 3 migration time: real 196m53.940s (3 hours, 17 minutes)
	Pulp 3 re-migration time: real 140m52.834s (2 hours, 21 minutes)
	Pulp 3 content switchover time: real 185m46.343s (3 hours, 6 minutes)
	This is quite slow.  To investigate further, run each step of Katello::Pulp3::MigrationSwitchover.run individually
